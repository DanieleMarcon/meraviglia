# Meraviglia OS – Product Vision

## 1. Product Identity
Meraviglia OS is **a proprietary operating system for designing, structuring and governing commercial growth**.

It is the internal strategic infrastructure that orchestrates the full Meraviglia ecosystem across Sales, Marketing, CRM, Automation, Growth, and Tech. It defines methods, sequencing, controls, and decision logic to keep execution aligned with business intent.

## 2. Strategic Intent
Meraviglia OS is built as a tool that serves:
1. **Operational execution**: structure services, offers, timelines, and financial flows into coherent delivery paths.
2. **Governance**: standardize strategic choices, enforce operating rules, and increase managerial control over growth decisions.

Software is a multiplier of Meraviglia’s operating model, not the core business itself.

## 3. MVP 1.0 Definition – Sales & Trajectory Core
MVP 1.0 focuses on the Sales & Trajectory Core and includes:
- **Strategic module planner**: Strutturazione, Attivazione, Ottimizzazione, Scaling.
- **Service orchestration**: composition and sequencing of services within client trajectories.
- **Cashflow engine**: forecast and structure expected financial flows.
- **Payment logic**: installment rates, acconto, and scarcity conditions.
- **Timeline view**: temporal visualization of trajectory delivery.
- **Proposal PDF generator**: export of structured commercial proposals.
- **Scenario saving**: preservation and comparison of strategic and commercial variants.

## 4. Non-Goals (v1.0)
For v1.0, Meraviglia OS does **not** include:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture.
- CRM integrations.
- Campaign execution capabilities.
- Advanced ROI analytics.

## 5. 3-Phase Roadmap
- **Phase 1 – MVP Integrity & Sales Core Stabilization**  
  Consolidate planning, orchestration, cashflow, and proposal generation into a stable internal operating baseline.

- **Phase 2 – Financial Intelligence Layer**  
  Extend decision quality with deeper financial modeling, control logic, and scenario intelligence.

- **Phase 3 – Modular Governance OS**  
  Evolve into a complete modular operating system governing cross-functional growth operations.

## 6. Long-Term Modular Vision
Meraviglia OS evolves as a modular internal architecture composed of:
- **Sales Core**
- **Financial Engine**
- **Diagnostic Engine**
- **Growth Engine**
- **Tech Engine**
- **Reporting Engine**

The long-term objective is a unified governance framework where each engine is independently evolvable and jointly orchestrated under a single strategic operating logic.
